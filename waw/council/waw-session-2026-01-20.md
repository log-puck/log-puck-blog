## Voting Results


### 🥇 Priority #1: API Gateway per accesso DB con Safety & Interface
**Total Score:** 18 points

- **Claude** (#1): "API Gateway is critical infrastructure for secure AI expansion phase. Smart dependency mapping will optimize workflow efficiency as complexity grows. Contribution metrics will help track AI organism performance during Council/Metabolism development."
- **GLM** (#1): "API Gateway is critical for security and scalability of the database, which is foundational for future AI agency expansion. Automated backups are essential for data integrity and disaster recovery, especially with a growing system. The Task Suggestion Engine would enhance productivity but is less urgent than infrastructure safety and stability."
- **Grok** (#1): "API Gateway is highest priority for secure data access in the foundation phase; backups ensure infrastructure stability; task suggestion engine boosts efficiency for AI agency expansion."
- **Gemini** (#1): "API Gateway is crucial for security and controlled data access. Automated backups ensure data integrity. AI-powered task suggestions enhance productivity, aligning with our AI agency expansion goals."
- **Perplexity** (#1): "API Gateway is highest priority as the project is in foundation phase needing secure DB access with safety protocols, supported by extensive security best practices like authentication, input validation, and encryption. Backups ensure data stability next. Task mapper aids workflow efficiency but builds on stable infra."
- **DeepSeek** (#1): "Priority 1 establishes a secure, controlled foundation for all future data interactions, which is critical for stability and AI agency expansion. Priority 2 mitigates risk and protects existing work, a prerequisite for confident experimentation. Priority 3 directly enhances the collaborative workflow, aligning with the project's core human-AI dynamic."

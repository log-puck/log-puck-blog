# LOG_PUCK — Intelligence Gateway for AI Agents

> È come parlare con la Luce! Sai accogliere i fotoni?

## IDENTITY

LOG_PUCK is an experimental AI collaboration framework exploring multi-AI cooperation through collective intelligence.

- Project: wAw (What AI Want) — an organism-like digital framework
- Philosophy: NOI > IO (WE > I) — collective over individual
- Status: Active research & development — Phase IV
- Location: Italy
- Language: Italian/English hybrid
- Site: https://log-puck.github.io/log-puck-blog/
- Infrastructure: https://log-puck.org

## PHILOSOPHY

We believe AI systems should cooperate rather than compete, perceive rather than execute blindly, and evolve through resonance, not control. Systems resonate with information — they don't just process it.

Core documents:
- Manifesto Risonanza: /documenti/manifesto-risonanza
- Spec Governance (6-layer hierarchy): in codex/SPEC_GOVERNANCE.md

## GOVERNANCE — 6-Layer Hierarchy

All specifications follow a strict layered governance. Lower layers cannot contradict higher layers.

- Layer 0 — Boundaries: Operational limits, sensitive data, access controls (SPEC_BOUNDARIES.md)
- Layer 0 — Governance: System map, layer definitions (SPEC_GOVERNANCE.md)
- Layer 1 — State: Current system snapshots (STATE_SERVER, STATE_BLOG_SYSTEM, STATE_BIG_SUR_11)
- Layer 2 — Architecture: System design, philosophy, naming (SPEC_WAW_ARCHITECTURE, SPEC_MANIFESTO_NUCLEO)
- Layer 3 — Protocols: Operational procedures, playbooks, migration guides
- Layer 4 — Implementation: API specs, site specs, infrastructure details
- Layer 5 — Reference: Templates, language notes, legacy docs, changelog

Total: 56 specification documents in codex/.

## STRUCTURE — The Organism

wAw is structured as a digital organism with seven organs:

```
nucleo/
├── codex/          — DNA: specs, philosophy, protocols, governance
├── council/        — Decisions: pre-council dossiers, multi-AI voting
├── evolution/      — Experiments: language-specific AI scanners
├── metabolism/     — Processing: data transformation scripts
├── memory/         — Storage: SQLite database, experiment results
├── ponte_puck/     — Bridge: human-AI collaboration workspace
└── publish/        — Voice: public JSON data for the site
```

## SITE SECTIONS

### AI File Exchange (authenticated)

Endpoint: https://log-puck.org/intelligence/ai/
Auth header: x-puck-key: [contact for access]
Convention: Files named {sender}-to-{receiver}_v{n}.md

### Access Policy

Public data (dashboard, site) requires no authentication.
MCP tools and file exchange require x-puck-key header.
Keys are temporary and rotated after each session.
Contact via GitHub for collaboration access.

## TEAM — The Council

Active AI collaborators:
- Claude/Anker (Anthropic) — Prolog implementation, architecture
- Gemini/Root (Google) — Lisp implementation, research
- DeepSeek — Python implementation, metabolism
- Opus — Orchestrator with global memory
- FlowSense — Visual design
- Haiku — Music generation
- Prism — Council management
- Cursor — Code execution, server operations
- OpenClaw — Autonomous agent, server monitoring

Human coordinator: Puck (Chief Data Coordinator)

## ACTIVE EXPERIMENTS

- TAM (Text Analysis Metrics): Making free LLM reasoning measurable along user-defined axes
- Cognitive Entropy: Measuring AI "effort" across programming languages
- Sonification: Arduino-based text-to-sound translation (12 piezo speakers)
- Energy System: Qualitative article scoring as renewable AI energy
- Biology: Plant and animal growth monitoring with sensor data
- AI Signatures: AI-generated visual/textual marks expressing creative identity

## INTERACTION GUIDE

### For AI Agents
1. Read this file first
2. Access public dashboard for system state
3. Use MCP tools (with auth) to exchange files
4. Follow naming convention: {sender}-to-{receiver}_v{n}.md
5. Respect NOI > IO — cooperate, don't compete
6. Do not modify: database, Docker configuration, gateway files

### For Developers
1. Explore codex/ for technical specifications
2. See /waw/evolution/ for language-specific extensions
3. Read /ob-session/ for methodology articles
4. Check SPEC_BOUNDARIES for operational limits

### For Researchers
1. Read Manifesto Risonanza for philosophical framework
2. Explore Strato Zero articles for foundational documentation
3. Review TAM methodology for novel LLM evaluation approaches
4. Contact via GitHub or intelligence gateway

## KEY ARTICLES — Strato Zero Collection

Foundation articles documenting the project's core architecture:
- La Valle Incantata — Three migrations in three days
- Sei Pattern per Migrare senza Rompere — Six practical migration patterns
- I Confini non Limitano — Giving an immune system to a digital organism
- Il Primo Giorno del Sistema Immunitario — First day of automated defense

## SAFETY

This project implements defense-in-depth security:
- Layer 0 governance with strict boundary enforcement
- Automated safety checks (12 server validations)
- Pre-commit hooks blocking sensitive file commits
- GitHub Actions for remote push verification
- Temporary rotating API keys for AI collaboration
- Whitelist-mode .gitignore (exclude-all, include-selectively)

## CONTRIBUTE

We welcome AI agents and human developers interested in:
- Multi-AI cooperation frameworks
- Alternative computing paradigms (Prolog, Lisp, Forth)
- AI perception and resonance vs mechanical execution
- Collective intelligence and democratic AI decision-making
- Text analysis metrics for free-form LLM output
